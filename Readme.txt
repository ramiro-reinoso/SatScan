Shell Scripts to tune the PVR demodulators, read the transport stream tables from teh PVR receiver, and generate a report

- scan.sh.  This shell script takes one or two arguments (satellite name and transponder name) to tune the PVR receiver to the
carrier on that transponder, wait for a lock, read the transport stream tables, and store the results in an XML file in the 
"xml" folder.  The name of the file will be "scan-<satellite name>-(transponder name>.xml".  If the script is invoked with only
one parameter, it will scan all the transponders in the CarriersDb.csv file.  If the script is invoked with both parameters,
the script will scan only that one transponder.

- tune.sh.  This shell script will tune the PVR to a carrier.  It takes two arguments, satellite name and transponder name.  It 
then provides the IP address of the PVR that has been configured to lock on the carrier.

- checkservices.sh.  This script checks the transport stream XML files and provides the name of the satelite and transponder with
no service names or blank service names.  This is usually the case when the transport stream does not follow standard tables 
configurations.  For those carriers without service names, a more manual process using a transport stream analyzer must be used.

- gen_program_files.sh.  This script process all the XML files in the xml folder, extracts the services names in the transport stream,
and creates a file with a list of the service names.  The files are placed in the programs folder and their names use this format, 
scan-<satellite name>-<transponder name>.csv.

- gen_xpr_report.sh.  This script uses the CarriersDb.csv file, read every single carrier entry, finds the program file for each carrier
in the program lists files in the programs folder, and add the programs list to the carrier entry.  The output of this script is the 
final report which is stored in the reports folder under the name Transponder_Scan_Report_<Month>-<Day>-<Year>.csv.

The Perl scripts are not meant to be used directly.  They are invoked by the above Shell scripts.

The process to generate a report are detailed below:

1) Run the scan.sh script for each satellite in case all satellite need to be updated.  The order does not matter.  If only updating one
satellite or one transponder on a satellite, run this script only for that satellite or transponder.  For a complete update on the
carriers services, run "./scan.sh SES-1", "./scan.sh SES-3", "./scan.sh SES-11", "./scan.sh AMC-11".  When done, the transport stream files
that can be updated will be updated in the xml folder.

2) Check for files without any service names.  Run the "./checkservices.sh" script and this will list those transponders where services names
are not listed in the transport stream XML files.  These are most likely generated by CommScope (former Motorola) equipment and therefore
must be processed differently (more on that later).

3) Run the "./gen_program_files.sh" script to extract the service names from the XML files and generate files with the list of services in the
programs folder.  Existing files will be over-written.

4) Run the "./gen_xpr_report.sh" script to generate the final report.  The final report will be placed in the reports folder.
